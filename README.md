## This is just an example on how to use the functional API in tf.keras to train MNIST with a custom training loop.

This is free to use without credit, although, I'd gladly accept a star on the repo for validation, if you want :3

Check out the docs and walkthroughs for more!  

Please note: This is a very inefficient way of batching. Kindly use
tf.data api for best results. 

Update: The tf.data api is surprisingly very easy to use. Add an issue if you'd like me to show an example of that, I'll try to make add it asap.
